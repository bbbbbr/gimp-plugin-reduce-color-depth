# GIMP Plugin for reducing the color bit depth of images
Allows for reducing the color bit-depth of the R/G/B channels source images (RGB-888/RGBA-8888) to between 1-8 bits. The channel bit-depths can be locked together or modified separately.

For example it can reduce an RGB-888 image to bit-depths used by old game consoles such as the Game Boy Color(BGR-555), Game Gear(BGR-444), or Sega Master System(BGR-222).
